This package contains the DeepLoc dataset that was introduced in the paper "VLocNet++: Deep Multitask Learning For Semantic Visual
Localization And Odometry". It contains a total of 3910 stereo pairs that were collected using a ZED stereo camera using our OBELIX robot platform in the University of Freiburg campus. It also contains high-resolution depth images that were generated by a CNN and therefore does not contain any holes or depth noise. We used a highly accurate LiDAR based SLAM system to obtain pose labels for every image. 

The robot traversed 10 loops with varying driving styles. The images are split into 2737 (7 loops) for training and 1173 (3 loops) for testing. Moreover, we provide pixel-level semantic annotations for 10 categories: Background, Sky, Road, Sidewalk, Grass, Vegetation, Building, Poles, Dynamic and Unknown. Every alternate image was labeled, amounting to 1367 images for training and 586 images for testing. The train and test splits are provied in the main folder. For more details regarding the data collection procedure please refer to the arXiv paper.

DESCRIPTION

Each train and test folder contain the following: 

*	LeftImages 		(left stereo image that corresponds to the semantic labels)

*	RightImages 		(right stereo image)

*	DepthImages 		(depth maps in pfm format)

*	CNN_DepthImages 	(depth images that were generated by a CNN)

*	labels 			(one channel png image with labels from 0 to 9)

*	labels_colorized 	(colorized labels for vizualization)

*	poses.txt		(6 DoF poses as translation and quaternion rotation x,y,z,qw,qx,qy,qz)

_____________________________________________________________________

RightImages, DepthImages and CNN_DepthImages are packaged into a seperate compressed folder that can be downloaded using the download_deeploc_stereo.sh script provided in the main folder.
